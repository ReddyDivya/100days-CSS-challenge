## CSS Position

### static 
     The position property for all HTML elements in CSS is set to static.
     static is the default position.
     
     position: static;
---
### relative 
    relative works the same way as position: static;, but it lets you change an element's position. 
    To modify the position, you'll need to apply the top, bottom, right, and left.

---
### absolute
    They are not positioned based on their usual place in the document flow, but based on the position of their ancestor.
    To modify the position, you'll need to apply the top, bottom, right, and left.

## transform()


### transform() - The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.


### translate - The translate property allows you to change the position of elements.

            transform:translate(x-axis, y-axis, z-axis);

### rotate() - defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it.
